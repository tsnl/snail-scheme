# macros

Source-code expansion is a key determinant of library and module structure (see `design.modules.md`).
- `include` and `include-ci` can be handled as a part of source-code expansion, top-level statements
  can be simplified (e.g. `begin` expanded into container, `define-syntax` separated from `define`),
  `cond-expand` is a whole can of worms
- Macros can be used to build many features atop a simpler few at no additional runtime cost.*

> *- this is a design decision: macros would be simpler if implemented as special lazy functions.

Initially, macro expansion will not support `cond-expand`.
- this enormously simplifies macro expansion, makes it easier to integrate macro expansion into the overall compilation toolchain.
- `include` and `include-ci` are expanded here.
- `import` and `export` are resolved here: library bindings are resolved for each phase-level because..
  - an `export` could expand to a macro that reveals an `apply` term to actually be a macro call
  - a macro could expand to more `export` statements or `import` statements that import macros
- macros iteratively expanded until a fixed-point

`eval` plays an important role in supporting `cond-expand`: implementing it and `cond-expand` should be a separate feature.
- support for basic `eval` not only required by spec, but also useful in evaluating expressions
- allowing VM to cache a global constant would be useful in this situation: modules expanded with the same cached environment produce the same result.
- compiler only accepts expanded objects, so must expand conditions before `eval`.

> once macro expansion is working, implement `eval` and use it to evaluate fully-expanded `cond` expressions.
